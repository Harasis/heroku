In this one hour long project-based course, you will learn the basics of support vector machines using Python and scikit-learn. The dataset we are going to use comes from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, and contains anonymized diagnostic measurements for a set of female patients. We will train a support vector machine to predict whether a new patient has diabetes based on such measurements. By the end of this project, you will have created a machine learning model using industry standard tools, and solved a real world medical diagnosis problem.
